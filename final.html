            <li>Weight Control: keeps the body at a sustained weight which is one benefit of a healthy lifestyle</li>
            <li>Improved Mood: maintains mental health and stability and creates a positive environment with motivation</li>
            <li>Disease Resistance: a healthy lifestyle is more resistant and immune to acquiring diseases</li>
            <li>Boosted Energy: your body recieves the fuel it needs to maintain a balanced energy level and keep you feeling refreshed rather than lethargic</li>
            <li>Increased Longevity: if a healthy lifestyle is maintained, chances are you will live to a greater extent and have a longer life</li>
